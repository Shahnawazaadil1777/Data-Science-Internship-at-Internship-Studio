# Data Science Internship Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Science Internship Project repository! ðŸš€ In this project, I had the opportunity to work on a comprehensive data analysis project during my internship at Internship Studio. The primary focus was on retail sales data, involving the creation of a MySQL database for efficient data management and analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Highlights

- **Database Creation:** Implemented a MySQL database to streamline data storage and retrieval processes, ensuring optimal efficiency.

- **Python Analytics:** Utilized Python in Jupyter Notebook for end-to-end data analysis, from data cleaning to advanced analytics.

- **Tabular and Visual Reports:** Generated insightful tabular reports through SQL queries and Python, showcasing sales trends by product, store, and month. Additionally, created visual reports using Python's data visualization libraries.

## Technologies Used

- MySQL Database
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Data Visualization Libraries

## Learning Experience

This project provided invaluable learning experiences, including:

- **Database Management:** Acquired hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and optimizing MySQL databases.

- **Data Analysis with Python:** Developed skills in Python for data analysis and visualization, using powerful libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

- **Advanced Analytics Techniques:** Applied segmentation and clustering techniques for more in-depth insights into the retail sales data.
